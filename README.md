This repository contains an exploratory data analysis (EDA) of the Titanic dataset, which is widely used in data science and machine learning tutorials. The Titanic dataset features information about passengers aboard the ill-fated RMS Titanic, such as their age, sex, class, and whether they survived or not. The goal of this project is to explore and analyze these features to uncover patterns, relationships, and insights that can help improve our understanding of the factors contributing to survival.
